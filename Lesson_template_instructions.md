## Additional instructions for the FAIR course

This course uses mike to host several versions of the course. Default is the latest version, that builds from the `main` branch. Once a course is done, and a new release has been created, a new version should be created manually with mike, to keep latest free for the next course instance.

To create a new version from the release, first install mike if you don't have it yet:
```bash
pip install mike
```

Make sure you are in the the release version you want to create. 

```bash
mike deploy <YYYY-MM> --push
```

This will create a new versioned folder in the `gh-pages` branch. The `--push` option will push the changes to the remote repository.
