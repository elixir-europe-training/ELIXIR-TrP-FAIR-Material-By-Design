Title: Releases and use of unique identifiers
To cover: 
- What is a DOI and why is it useful for training materials 
- Different strategies for adding DOIs for training materials
- Connecting a GitHub repository with Zenodo to assign a DOI
- Use releases in GitHub to make new versions  
To Reuse:
- chapter 10 FAIR trianing handbook -> https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-FAIR-training-handbook/chapters/chapter_10/

!!! success "Learning Outcomes"

    - Compare different strategies for unique identifiers for training material
    - Create versioned DOI for training material in a GitHub repository 




# Outline:
## 1.1 Unique identifiers for training materials (30 min)
- What is a unique persistent identifier?

A persistent identifier is a type of metadata that uniquely tags a digital object. 
 - leads to a landing page with the listed digital object and its metadata. Actual access to the digital object from this page might be restricted. 

- Why is it useful for training materials?
Help distinguish between :
- different materials
- different versions of the same material

-  Versioning of DOIs

- Explore different strategies
    -   group exercise, presenting strategies to each other


## 1.2 Selecting a strategy for unique identifiers (30 min)
-   DOI for presentations
-   DOI for repositories and releases
-   Individual/pair-wise work for their own context, look at the aspects and evaluate which strategy to use 


## 1.4 Implementing your strategy (50 min)
Steps in the exercise
- Login/create a Zenodo account in Zenodo sandbox (Easiest via GitHub)
- Link the repo and the Zenodo account from Zenodo)
- Create an item
- Add DOI badge to repo (make sure to use DOI for all versions)
- Create a new release (the release notes are the description by default)
- Update TeSS




# Instructor notes

## Activity Case Studies of Using PIDs in Training

### execution
- Divide students in 3 groups (or more if needed)
- Assign each group a use case
- Group discussions for 10 minutes
- Plenary discussion for 10 minutes (more time will be needed if you have more groups but if there are 2 groups with the same use case group 1 can summarize the strategy and group 2 can share their pros and cons, then gruop 1 can be invited to add any additional pros and cons thay discussed)
### Instructions to students:
You will discuss one use case per group and then share this with the rest of the groups. 
- Assign someone to take notes in the shared document
- Read the use case and discuss benefits and drawbacks of the strategy used inyour use case
- Write down short summary of the strategy and the pros and 
### Preparations:
- In the collaborative notes document: Link to the use cases, sections for each group to write in
