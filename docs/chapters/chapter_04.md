# Acknowledgements and FAIR principles

In this case, when I'm talking about acknowledgements, I mean something very broad. While in most cases this is referring the authorship and collaborations, before we get there I want to bring a more comprehensive reflexion. 

All along creating our training material we use images, videos, text, other materials, etc and as musch as for scientific purposes acknowledging these is also extremelly important. To make sure also your efforts are acknowledged accordingly you should asign a license to the material.

Let's start talking a bit more about each aspect.

## Licences

A license is a formal and practical way to make people know what they should, what they can and cannot do with your material, no matter what type of material you think about. There are different types of liscences to support you in keeping the property rights clear. Most of the times when talking about training material we are talking about a creative work. In this case a good license option is the [_creative commons_ (CC)](https://creativecommons.org/). 

The CC licenses will allow you to [combine different options](https://creativecommons.org/mission/downloads/), depending if you want to make it fully open, or if you want to make clear some limitations of the use of your material. An example is to have it open but restricted to the obligation of acknowledging the original work, so people can use and adpat as long as a citation is made. In other hands, maybe you prefer that it is not used for commercial purposes, or that is can only be using as long as keeping the same licence type.

It is an scale, see it bellow:

**CC0** means you can freely use! While **(C)** means all rights reserved.
Between them you can find many options, this course for example is under the **CCBY**, second one in the right top, and it means you can share and adpat as long as citing **by** whon it was created.

As you have seen in previous chapter, open and FAIR are not the same. So even if you have all rights reserved it can still be FAIR, it can be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Maybe to reuse you need to pay, but it means is not open, but stil FAIR. What we strongly encourage is to use a CCBY or similar, where you are recognized but it is still open, so combining both principles FAIR and OPEN.

It is good to remember that this should be taken in account in both directions! Always, **ALWAYS** check the licenses of materials, iamges and videos you want to use, and add a license to your materials.

> ✍️ ACTIVITY
>
> I challange you to to take a look in the links and the options and choose one license for your project. Discuss with you group the advantages and disadvantages and let's go one step ahead in being FAIR.
