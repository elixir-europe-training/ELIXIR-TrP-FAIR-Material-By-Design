# Acknowledgements and FAIR principles

In this case, when I'm talking about acknowledgements, I mean something very broad. While in most cases this is referring the authorship and collaborations, before we get there I want to bring a more comprehensive reflexion. 

All along creating our training material we use images, videos, text, other materials, etc and as musch as for scientific purposes acknowledging these is also extremelly important. To make sure also your efforts are acknowledged accordingly you should asign a license to the material.

Let's start talking a bit more about each aspect.

## Licences

A license is a formal and practical way to make people know what they should, what they can and cannot do with your material, no matter what type of material you think about. There are different types of liscences to support you in keeping the property rights clear. Most of the times when talking about training material we are talking about a creative work. In this case a good license option is the [_creative commons_ (CC)](https://creativecommons.org/). 

The CC licenses will allow you to [combine different options](https://creativecommons.org/mission/downloads/), depending if you want to make it fully open, or if you want to make clear some limitations of the use of your material. An example is to have it open but restricted to the obligation of acknowledging the original work, so people can use and adpat as long as a citation is made. In other hands, maybe you prefer that it is not used for commercial purposes, or that is can only be using as long as keeping the same licence type.

It is an scale, see it bellow:

</figure>

**CC0** means you can freely use! While **(C)** means all rights reserved.
Between them you can find many options, this course for example is under the **CCBY**, second one in the right top, and it means you can share and adpat as long as citing **by** whon it was created.

As you have seen in previous chapter, open and FAIR are not the same. So even if you have all rights reserved it can still be FAIR, it can be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Maybe to reuse you need to pay, but it means is not open, but stil FAIR. What we strongly encourage is to use a CCBY or similar, where you are recognized but it is still open, so combining both principles FAIR and OPEN.

It is good to remember that this should be taken in account in both directions! Always, **ALWAYS** check the licenses of materials, iamges and videos you want to use, and add a license to your materials.

> I challange you to to take a look in the links and the options and choose one license for your project. Discuss with you group the advantages and disadvantages and let's go one step ahead in being FAIR.

## Illustrations

#### Images with free licenses

Many of us, if not all, are used to find images on your favorite search engine and coping-pasting it to make a shine, bright and atractive presentation, text or to ilustrate whatever training material we will develop. 

Depite of being tempting, you should not do it as simple as this. You should check the license of the image you want to use, and I can share with my personal experience in trying to do it afterwards ... Avoid it! Finding the same image months later and even wrose finding its licese can be very challanging and time consuming. 

I had the experience of finding out one of the images I was using actually had a paying license and had to replace it.

> ✍️ ACTIVITY
>
> I have a challange for you! Can you find the source and the license of the image bellow?

My advise for you is to either do your own illustration or use free liscensed images. In most cases the free licenses require that you acknowledge the source (ilustrator and maybe illustration website). This is the same for icons or very fancy illustrations! So maybe I can share with you some websites, in case you are not a Picasso or a Van gogh, you can still have nice visuals for your material.

This three websites will give free and non-free licences. In some cases it is free for private use but not to make publicly available. But, now that you know you can check before using it. Search an image, check the license and choose what you want to use in your material. If you love an iamge and have the budget to usem **ENJOY**, if you rather not pay, choose the free ones that allown public sharing.

Let's do now the easier way, first find the image and its license, and then you decided weather to use it!

> ✍️ ACTIVITY
>
> Chose an image from at least one of the websites to use in your material. Check its license, and if it fits with the purpose of this material and with how you intend (or not) to sahre it.
>
> Don't forget to acknowledge the illustrator and preferrentially add a link if other want to use it from the original source. If youare aloud to not acknowledge, share the link in the activity so your trainners and colleges can see it.

#### Create your own images 

1. Inkscape

Programs to make illustrations such as Inkscape or Adobe ilustrator might be an option to use all your creativity and create your own images to which you can choose your own licenses and use freely. Inkscape is free to use different from Adobe or Photoshop. But whatever you choose keep in mind that the leanring curve for learning how to use these is real.

Nevertheless, I encourage you to look online, there are several videos that might help on this process. 

This strategy can bring a lot of creativity and fredon, but also time investment and in times like this you might be asking yourself 'What if I use AI to create my images'. Well, there are a few things to consider. Check the next topic.

2. with AI

Artificial inteligence (AI) is a tempting, very powerful tool. However the world is just learning from it and adjusting to such power and its consequences. For the generative AI, thinking from the illustrations point of view there are still a lot of uncertenty.

There is no one agrement to whom own the image rights, not all genAI make openly clear what database is being use to train their algorithim. What brings the most important consideration, genAI is trained based in existante image-references and this has several consequeces, I'll try to mention some that you should be carreful with just before telling how you can use this resource to your benefit.

First you need to consider that the world we live is been fighting againt a lot of bieses and genAI is not very good at fighting it, unless you make your description very clear (and that is our biggest challagne perhapes). In world with etinical and gender bieases among many others, genAI has the tendency of returning images that reinforce this patterns so you need to be mindful and probably do some reiterations to get away of these.

> add example here

Another very important thing to take in account is the copyrights around GenAI-images. It is not clear yet how to define, and each country might have a different way to approach it. Regardless, it is all so new, that I would expect that there is still a lot to happen around this disscussion.

But to give you an overview on the topic, and most importantly, some hints on how to navigate this waters. In 2023 [Lim Yong Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/who-owns-copyright-ai-generated-art-lim-yong-lin/), a lawier working with intelectual property, and [Anas Hassan]((https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ai-image-generator-how-you-can-avoid-copyright-anas-hassan-/)), text writer and computer scientist exploring AI, both commented in some of the challanges to determine who has the copyrights of an AI generated image. 

From the tecnological point if e advocate that AI is the one generating the image, it might be argued that it belongs to the person or copany operating the AI system.It could also be angued that who provided the data to train the AI or has trained the AI, owns it since they are _"the source"_. But the creative input is given by a third person that is accesing the AI and giving their instructions something was created, so they should have the copyrights for the "_idea_". To close this comlpex reflexion, I would like to bring the perspective that if AI is using existing data, and if the image contains references to another piece how do you define where the copyrights of the original piece ends and the nee AI generated image beggins? 

The point is, there is no clear definition yet to solve any of the discussions above, and so it is most likelly seen case-by-case.

But we agree it is a nice and useful tool to create images, so to try to avoid problems there are things you can consider. While might seam obvious, is still very good to reminded. Here is the list of hints based in what Annas Hassan said in his article:

1. Use AI to create works that are sufficiently different from existing works
    
    - Use different datasets
    - Use unique prompts and parameters

2. Use AI to assist in the creative process rather than replacing it! 

    - Uee AI to generate ideas and inspiration
    - Combine with a human creator

3. Make clear you have used AI and which genAI you have used

    - P.S.: This can help avoiding confusion and misunderstandings about the originality

4. Be mindfull whith the description you give to genAI

    - Think twice before utilizing any artist's name
    - Think twice before using other creations as reference
    - Avoid mentioning works that are already protected by copyright
    - Uploading existing reference is prohibited unless you own the copyright

5. Check you AI tool's terms of service

    - Not all of them allow for commercial usage of the generated photos/images

6. Avoid very general suggestions

7. Use tools for reverse image search to verify outcomes.

    - examples: Google Lens or Google Reverse Image

8. Save the prompt that was used to generate each image
    
    - Save it in the metadata for future reference

**"Most AI Image Generators still stand on their terms that all generated images are free to use, but better still, when using them, reference the image to the platform of the creator" -Anas Hassan-**

#### To keep in mind when choosing ilustrations

* Keep it clean and meaninful
* Avoid stereotypes, be inlcusive
