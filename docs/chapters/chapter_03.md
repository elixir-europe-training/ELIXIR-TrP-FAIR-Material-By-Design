## Discussion topics


## Exercise: Set up a course website

Now once you have your course syllabus and learning outcomes, it's time to set up a course website where we can display all this information. A course website helps make your training findable and accessible for your students and the rest of the world.

Depending on your technical skills and preferences, you may choose either of these 3 options below for hosting your website:

### Different prerequisities


<div style="background-color:lightgreen; padding-top:7px; padding-bottom:1px; padding-left:15px; border-radius:10px;margin-bottom:10px;">
<b>Easy technical</b><br>
No knowledge of github needed
</div>

<div style="background-color:#F8C471; padding-top:7px; padding-bottom:1px; padding-left:15px; border-radius:10px;margin-bottom:10px;">
<b>Intermediate technical</b><br>
Basic knowledge of github needed (clone, push, pull) + basic markdown skills
</div>

<div style="background-color:#D98880; padding-top:7px; padding-bottom:1px; padding-left:15px; border-radius:10px;margin-bottom:10px;">
<b>Advanced technical</b><br>
Intermediate knowledge of github needed (clone, push, pull, gh-pages configuration) + basic quarto knowledge
</div>
<br>

### Using github and Liascript (intermediate)

#### Create repo 
Create a github repo from template at [https://github.com/vibbits/training_material_template](). Make sure the repo is public.

#### Clone the repo
Clone the repo to your local computer.

#### Generate course website
Copy the url of the README.md page on github and paste it here: [https://liascript.github.io/](). You can use the generated url to send to your course participants. The website will be generated locally on their computers, directly from github.

#### Add learning outcomes
Update the README.md file on your computer to add learning outcomes and syllabus. Push the changes to github to make them render on the course website. You might have to force refresh your browser to see the changes on the site.

<br> 

### Using github pages and Quarto (advanced)

If you choose this option we assume you are experienced enough to create a repo, start a new Quarto project, and set up a gh-pages to display the course website.

A few things you should consider when creating the quarto pages:

- Make sure to add authors where applicable
- Add a page with your Learning outcomes and course syllabus

You can use the Liascript template from the previous option as inspiration.
