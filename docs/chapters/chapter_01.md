# What is FAIR

In the [Cambrige dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fair) the word **fair** can stand for _something that is resonable, what you expected or deserve_, but I'd like to elaborate more about the acronym FAIR. In this case each letter stands for something different:

I would also say it is resonable and what I would expect! So, FAIR is just fair, don't you agree?

Well, before you can decide if you agree or not maybe I should tell you more about each part of this acronym.
From the need of reusing scholar data in research, was born the idea of a consise and mesurable set of principles to endorse reusability, the **FAIR** principles. The idea is that those need to be available for individuals but also in a machine redable format.


!!! danger "Challenge 1"

    Before looking for the answers bellow, try to answer with your current knoledge and perspective
    
    "How would you interpret each of this principles?" 
    
    Elaborate shortly how you see each of them (in general and for training) and thenn compare with the text bellow:
    
    1. Findable:
    2. Accessible:
    3. Interoperable:
    4. Reusable:


<span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.5em; color:#008B8B;">F</span><span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.5em;">indable:</span>

From the data perspective, to be considerable findable according to the FAIR principle both Data and MetaData should be findable by humans and machines. It essential to think on both, since the machine is allowing automatic discovery. These should be assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier so can be unambiguously identified. The metadata is going to be an structured description of the data and should also be machine redable.

From the training point of view, all of this is true, the training material must contain unique and persistent identifiers linked to the material and their metadata and should be findable online properly described. To increase findability, the descriptions using [Schema.org](http://schema.org/) will guide with the metadata annotation allowing for training registries to list and share this material with the training community.

<span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.5em; color:#008B8B;">A</span><span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.5em;">ccessible:</span>

After finding the data or training material, we should know how we can access it. Not just by clicking a link or downloading something, the most important information is on the exact condition to access it! Idealy the conditions are sharede by clearly satting which license or including terms of use. Possibly it is needed an autentication with email registration or similar, if is paid access or free, or if it domain restrict, etc.

<span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.5em; color:#008B8B;">I</span><span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.5em;">nteroperable:</span>

Next thing you will need is to check for integration. That might be more obvious from the (meta)data perspective, when thinkin on file formats and their compatibility with different tools, also the usability in different operational systems. However it is also refering to the use of controled vocabulary (ontologies) and qualified references (with clear links or context), in the example by [**GO-FAIR**](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) "*X is regulator of Y*" instead of "*X is associated with Y*".

In the training perspective we should also make use of controled vocabulary everytime it is possible, specially in the metadata. Still, the most chalanging part is when we think of types of training materia. We will have a session about that and the challanges and solutions aiming for interoperability. But to give you grasp on the topic think on the reuse, version control and version release of PDFs, powerpoints and others.

<span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.5em; color:#008B8B;">R</span><span style="font-family:serif; font-size:1.5em;">eusable:</span>

The ultimate goal of the FAIR principals it **REUSABILITY**, to get here you need to have navigated in the previous principles and get somethings done already. Nonetheless this principle is about the ability to really **USING** the (meta)data, or the training material. 

Ideally it can be used by trainees and trainers, and is welcoming collaborations and feedback. It has to be up to date. If you think about slides-presentations, for example, each slide needs notes and context so other trainers can reuse it (annotation), the format is friendly so people can reuse as a whole, just a extract or adapted version. If the license allows so.

It is good to commment at this point, that this is a process, and you won't get all set in one day. It will be built along the process of creating your material, as you will see during this course. Check bellow an overview of the 10 rules to make training material:

## How FAIR and OPEN applies to Training material

    Here you can put a note using admonitions.
