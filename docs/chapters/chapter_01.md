# What is FAIR

In the [Cambrige dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/fair) the word **fair** can stand for _something that is resonable, what you expected or deserved_, but I'd like to elaborate more about the acronym FAIR. In this case each letter stands for something different:

- **F** = Findable
- **A** = Accessible
- **I** = Interoperable
- **R** = Reusable

I would also say it is resonable and what I would expect. So, FAIR is just fair, don't you agree?

Well, before you can decide if you agree or not maybe I should tell you more about each part of this acronym.
From the need of reusing scholar data in research was born the idea of a consise and mesurable set of principles to endorse reusability, the **FAIR** principles. The idea is that those need to be available for individuals but also in a machine redable format.
