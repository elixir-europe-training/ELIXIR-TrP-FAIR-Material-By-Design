1. Sample video critique - how FAIR is this?
2. What is your experience with creating videos?
3. AI discussion - video production
    - How might using AI tools affect learning?
    - What biases might this genAI output be subject to?
    - Where would you not want to use AI tools?
    - Where could AI tools help you in developing learning materials? 


## 6.3 Exercise: Generate a caption or transcript to a sample video

You can download [the sample video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TdwvG0R5_UGFCE9jAOZXjloCoVk1dfoz/view?usp=sharing) from the course website or record a 1-2 minute video on your smartphone or laptop to use.

    Ensure you do not record anyone without their permission!

### 6.3.1 OpenAI Whisper tutorial

The following cheat sheet explains several ways of achieving a LLM-generated transcription. These are: 

- Recommended: Using the SciLifeLab serve instance of Whisper (recommended, easy)
- Independent: Using an on-device GUI such as Whisper Transcription
- Challenge mode: Installing your own local instance of Whisper

When you are finished transcription, inspect the transcript and answer the following:

- Is it accurate? 
- Is it usable?
- How does this help me achieve FAIR learning aims?

### 6.3.2 Adding FAIR video & transcript to your sample course

Following the basic guidelines for FAIR video material in the slides, add your video to your sample course.

!!! tip
    If you created your own video, you can use your [SciLifeLab NextCloud Folder](https://nextcloud.dc.scilifelab.se/login) to host it.
