!!! success "Learning Outcomes"

     By the end of this session, learners will be able to:  
      
    - Explain why video materials should follow FAIR principles and identify key challenges in doing so  
    - Evaluate how FAIR a given video is, using real examples
    - Apply minimum FAIR-by-design practices when creating or sharing training videos 
    - Generate and use transcripts or captions to enhance accessibility and interoperability

## 6.2 Why FAIR video materials matter
Video is one of the most powerful ways to enhance learning, but only if it can be found, accessed, reused, and understood by others.
Making your video materials FAIR ensures that the effort you invest in creating them continues to have impact long after the initial training. 

!!! question "Reflection"

    Before we dive deeper, take a moment to reflect:  
      
      - Have you used / are you planning to use video material in your training?  
      - What kind of video material? (e.g., recorded lectures, interviews, demonstrations, or animations)  
      - Why or why not?   

### Why video media is a great tool for learning
Video media is great for enhancing & contextualizing learning! Some advantages include:  
  
- Improved retention and understanding:  combining visual and auditory information engages multiple senses → dual coding theory (1, 2)
- Supports flexible, self-paced learning: learners can pause, rewind, or rewatch segments at their own pace (3, 4) 
- Enables asynchronous learning: learners access materials anytime, anywhere  
- Provides authentic demonstrations: e.g. when teaching lab techniques, workflows, or software use  
- Increases accessibility and inclusion: captions, transcripts, and translations make content more widely usable  

  
### Types of video materials that can be made FAIR
  
There are many ways to use video as a training resource, for example: voiceovers added to slides or presentations, screen recordings showing workflows/coding/software demonstrations, interviews with experts or practitioners, lecture recordings or seminars, animations and explainer videos, hands-on demonstrations in labs or fieldwork settings. All of these can be made FAIR!  

Let's now have a look at what it takes to FAIRify video material: 

!!! note "Exercise"

    Find a short video (for example, on YouTube, Protocols.io, Zenodo, or another platform) that you might want to include in your own course, or use one of two sample videos that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUGsZgQaAZs) and [here](https://www.protocols.io/view/video-protocol-for-sorting-drosophila-pupae-n2bvjx8nwlk5/v1) For your chosen video, take 5–10 minutes to assess:  
    
    - Findable → Is it hosted on a trusted platform? Does it have a DOI or persistent identifier?
    - Accessible → Is the access type and language defined? Can the video or transcript be downloaded? 
    - Interoperable → Are there captions or transcripts? Is it in a standard format (e.g. .mp4, .mov)?
    - Reusable → Is there a clear license? Are contributors and tools properly attributed? Is there versioning information?

    Document your findings [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTAvSqdNhrO_ZNsRvzPSulFxucFkbNN7UvnC1oFvyFZtG4H0wZWBgcGFWct2ynB8eFA3UwDeAehT_Xb/pub)

!!! question "Reflection"

    Take a moment to reflect:  
    
    - Was the video material you chose FAIR?  
    - How easy would it be for you to reuse this material?   
    - If not easy: what information would you need to make reuse easier?  

      
### Why FAIR video materials matter  
Making your video materials FAIR increases their long-term value and educational impact:  
  
- It makes it easy to locate videos  
- It supports asynchronous learning when videos can be viewed or downloaded anytime, anywhere   
- It enables using videos across platforms and tools  
- It allow others to legally adapt or remix content  
- It ensures videos remain available and understandable over time  

**FAIR video = more impact from the effort you put into creating it**
By sharing your training videos in a FAIR way, you amplify their reach, support diverse learners, and contribute to a more open and connected scientific training ecosystem.


## 6.3 Barriers to creating FAIR video materials 



: Generate a caption or transcript to a sample video

You can download [the sample video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TdwvG0R5_UGFCE9jAOZXjloCoVk1dfoz/view?usp=sharing) from the course website or record a 1-2 minute video on your smartphone or laptop to use.
!!! warning
    Ensure you do not record anyone without their permission!

### 6.3.1 OpenAI Whisper tutorial

The following cheat sheet explains several ways of achieving a LLM-generated transcription. These are: 

- Recommended: Using the SciLifeLab serve instance of Whisper (recommended, easy)
- Independent: Using an on-device GUI such as Whisper Transcription
- Challenge mode: Installing your own local instance of Whisper

You can also download this cheat sheet as a pdf [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hahGc_k3WVtqRRnlwkmGq-hKJe-5or4v/view?usp=share_link)

When you are finished transcription, inspect the transcript and answer the following:

- Is it accurate? 
- Is it usable?
- How does this help me achieve FAIR learning aims?

### 6.3.2 Adding FAIR video & transcript to your sample course

Following the basic guidelines for FAIR video material in the slides, add your video to your sample course.

!!! tip
    If you created your own video, you can use your [SciLifeLab NextCloud Folder](https://nextcloud.dc.scilifelab.se/login) to host it.
