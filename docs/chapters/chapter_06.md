## 6.2 Why FAIR video materials matter
Video is one of the most powerful ways to enhance learning, but only if it can be found, accessed, reused, and understood by others.
Making your video materials FAIR ensures that the effort you invest in creating them continues to have impact long after the initial training. 

!!! question "Reflection"

    Before we dive deeper, take a moment to reflect:  
      
      - Have you used / are you planning to use video material in your training?  
      - What kind of video material? (e.g., recorded lectures, interviews, demonstrations, or animations)  
      - Why or why not?   

### Why video media is a great tool for learning
Video media is great for enhancing & contextualizing learning! Some advantages include:  
  
- Improved retention and understanding:  combining visual and auditory information engages multiple senses → dual coding theory (1, 2)
- Supports flexible, self-paced learning: learners can pause, rewind, or rewatch segments at their own pace (3, 4) 
- Enables asynchronous learning: learners access materials anytime, anywhere  
- Provides authentic demonstrations: e.g. when teaching lab techniques, workflows, or software use  
- Increases accessibility and inclusion: captions, transcripts, and translations make content more widely usable  

  
### Types of video materials that can be made FAIR
  
There are many ways to use video as a training resource, for example: voiceovers added to slides or presentations, screen recordings showing workflows/coding/software demonstrations, interviews with experts or practitioners, lecture recordings or seminars, animations and explainer videos, hands-on demonstrations in labs or fieldwork settings. All of these can be made FAIR!  

Let's now have a look at what it takes to FAIRify video material: 

!!! note "Exercise"

    Find a short video (for example on YouTube, Protocols.io, Zenodo, or another platform) that you might want to include in your own course, or use one of two sample videos that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUGsZgQaAZs) and [here](https://www.protocols.io/view/video-protocol-for-sorting-drosophila-pupae-n2bvjx8nwlk5/v1). For your chosen video, take 5–10 minutes to assess:  
    
    - **Findable** → Is it hosted on a trusted platform? Does it have a DOI or persistent identifier?
    - **Accessible** → Is the access type and language defined? Can the video or transcript be downloaded? 
    - **Interoperable** → Are there captions or transcripts? Is it in a standard format (e.g. .mp4, .mov)?
    - **Reusable** → Is there a clear license? Are contributors and tools properly attributed? Is there versioning information?

    Document your findings in the [**Checklist for minimally FAIR video material**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTAvSqdNhrO_ZNsRvzPSulFxucFkbNN7UvnC1oFvyFZtG4H0wZWBgcGFWct2ynB8eFA3UwDeAehT_Xb/pub)

!!! question "Reflection"

    After the exercise, take a moment to reflect:  
    
    - Was the video material you chose FAIR?  
    - How easy would it be for you to reuse this material?   
    - If not easy: what information would you need to make reuse easier?  

      
### Why FAIR video materials matter  
Making your video materials FAIR increases their long-term value and educational impact:  
  
- It makes them easy to locate  
- It supports asynchronous learning when they can be viewed or downloaded anytime, anywhere   
- It enables using them across platforms and tools  
- It allow others to legally adapt or remix them  
- It ensures they remain available and understandable over time  

In short: **FAIR video = more impact from the effort you put into creating it**  
By sharing your training videos in a FAIR way, you amplify their reach, support diverse learners, and contribute to a more open and connected scientific training ecosystem.


## 6.3 Barriers to creating FAIR video materials 
Making video materials FAIR can be highly rewarding — but it’s not always straightforward. There are practical, technical, and even ethical challenges that educators and trainers often face.  

!!! question "Reflection"

    Before we look at common barriers, take a moment to reflect:  
    What’s the biggest barrier for you in using and FAIRifying video material? Is it related to technology, time, or something else?

Below are some of the most common obstacles encountered when creating or sharing FAIR video materials:

| **Barrier** | **Description** |
|--------------|------------------|
| **Time & Resources** | Creating, editing, and annotating videos takes planning and effort. |
| **Technical Skills** | Recording, editing, adding metadata, and creating captions require some know-how. |
| **Knowledge Gaps** | Limited awareness of FAIR video practices or suitable hosting platforms. |
| **Infrastructure** | Not all organizations have repositories or tools for storing videos with FAIR metadata. |
| **Licensing & Permissions** | Confusion about copyright, reuse rights, and privacy when sharing video content. |
| **AI & Ethics** | Emerging tools (e.g., for transcription or editing) raise questions about bias, transparency, and attribution. |
| **File Size & Storage Limits** | High-quality video files are large, making them harder to host on institutional repositories or platforms like Zenodo (often limited to 50 GB per upload). |
| **Metadata Complexity** | Video materials often need multiple layers of metadata (e.g., author, content, format, transcript, licensing), and it’s not always clear where or how to include these. |

Even though these barriers exist, many can be overcome with planning, collaboration, and the right tools. In the next section, we’ll look at practical steps and minimum FAIR-by-design practices to help make your video materials more FAIR without requiring expert-level skills.  
  

## 6.4 AI and FAIR video material 

### A workflow for making FAIR video material with the use of AI  

A potential way to mitigate some of the barriers to FAIR video materials is to use AI tools at different stages of video creation. The workflow below illustrates which tools, some of which use AI, can support each stage:   

![](../../assets/images/06-fair-video-material-ai.png)<!-- style="width: 550px;" -->  

As the workflow illustrates, AI tools can help overcome several common barriers in creating FAIR video materials, from generating scripts to editing, transcribing, and hosting videos. While AI can speed up production and reduce workload, it’s important to remember that using AI does not automatically make content FAIR. For example, an AI-generated transcript may improve accessibility, but if it is not properly formatted, licensed, or shared with metadata, it will not be findable or reusable. Likewise, AI platforms may store outputs in proprietary formats or behind authentication walls, limiting accessibility and interoperability. Ensuring FAIRness thus requires deliberate steps by the creator, such as applying open licenses, adding persistent identifiers, using open formats, and providing rich, structured metadata. 

!!! question "Reflection"
     
     Use AI with caution!  
     
     - Is AI-generated content FAIR?  
     - How can you ensure quality and accuracy?  
     - How might AI affect creativity and learner engagement?  
     - How should we credit AI contributions?   

### Indicating AI contributions  

If you do decide to use AI tools in your video creation process, it is important to indicate its contribution properly to ensure transparency, maintain trust, and support FAIR principles. Properly stating AIs contribution makes the provenance of your materials understandable for both humans and machines, and helps others to responsibly reuse or adapt your video content.    
  
General guidelines for indicating AI contribution:   

| **Aspect** | **Guidelines / Examples** |
|------------|---------------------------|
| **Crediting AI** | For AI tools that had a creative or technical role: *“Script generated with ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2025)”* |
| **Describing the role of AI** | Explain how an AI tool was used, e.g., *“Voiceover synthesized using Microsoft Azure TTS”* |
| **Crediting AI in metadata or end credits** | *“Video created by [Name], 2025. Script drafted with ChatGPT (OpenAI, version x.x). Captions generated using Whisper (OpenAI). Edited in CapCut.”* |
| **Citing AI in reference lists / FAIR records** | *Luijten, I. (2025). Creating FAIR video materials [Video]. Script generated with ChatGPT (OpenAI). Captions via Whisper (OpenAI). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.xxxx/zenodo.xxxxx* |
| **Licensing AI-generated content** | License with CC BY or CC BY-SA to allow reuse with attribution. State if remixing or AI reuse is permitted. |


### Adding transcripts to videos: WhisperAI

One essential step in FAIRifying video training materials is adding captions or a transcript, because it transforms the spoken content into machine-readable and searchable text. This improves **findability**, as search engines and repositories can index the text and help others discover your content. It also enhances **accessibility**, ensuring that people with hearing impairments or those who prefer reading can still engage with the material. In addition, transcripts and captions promote **interoperability** by allowing the content to be reused across different platforms, formats, or languages. Finally, they increase **reusability**, since the text can be cited, translated, remixed, or integrated into other learning materials, all while preserving the original meaning and context.  
<br>  
The following exercise is designed to give you hands-on practice with generating transcripts and captions. There are three levels of difficulty available, but for this course, we recommend you complete Level 1, which is suitable for beginners and covers the core skills needed to make your videos FAIR by adding a transcript or caption.
