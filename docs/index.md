## Lesson overview

!!! overview ""
    :fontawesome-regular-bookmark: **Description**  
    This 2 days course is based on the FAIR training handbook and 10 simple rules to make material FAIR publication. All sessions are structured in a way that complement each other aiming to introduce participants with a theoretical & hands-on approach of how to design FAIR training material.
    
    Activities are intended to increase the technical skills and critical thinking during the development of a new training course. From A to Z participants are going to be challenged to work in a group to build a FAIR lesson on a topic to be presented at the end of the course. Come inspired!
