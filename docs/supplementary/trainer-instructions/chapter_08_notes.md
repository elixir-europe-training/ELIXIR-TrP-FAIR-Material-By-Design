## Activity 1 - Reflection (slide 10)

- discussion with the whole group
- In the context of training materials why are PIDs needed? 
- Which identifier should be used for each need?


## Activity 2 - Case Study (slide 11)
- Divide students in 3 groups (or more if needed)
- Assign each group a use case
- Group discussions for 10 minutes
- Plenary discussion for 10 minutes (more time will be needed if you have more groups but if there are 2 groups with the same use case group 1 can summarize the strategy and group 2 can share their pros and cons, then gruop 1 can be invited to add any additional pros and cons thay discussed)

**Instructions to students:**
You will discuss one use case per group and then share this with the rest of the groups. 
- Assign someone to take notes in the shared document
- Read the use case and discuss benefits and drawbacks of the strategy used inyour use case
- Write down short summary of the strategy and the pros and 

**Preparations:**
- In the collaborative notes document: Link to the use cases, sections for each group to write in


## Activity 3 - Reflection (slide 15)
- Individual reflection that might be left as an "after the course homework" depending on time. 
- If this is taught in a context where several ppl are from the same team or organisation it might be useful to do this as a group discussion.


## Activity 4 - Turtorial

- let the grouops go through the self-guided tutorial
- inform that there are additional exercises if they are done. The reflective activity could also be done to fill the time if needed
