## Group discussion on FAIR-ness of each hosting/delivery system
- Reflect individually for each missing box in the table
- Go through in whole class for the missing boxes and discuss what they concluded
- Make the notes directly in the slides, so they are updated in real time on the course page

## Case studies
- Reflect individually for each case
- In whole group, discuss each part of FAIR for the course, and if it is FAIR or not
- Make the notes in the slides, so they are updated in real time on the course website

## Exercise: set up your own course website
- Trainees should work in pairs of 2.
- There are 3 options for setting up the course website, explained in the github page
- If the trainee doesn't have any github knowledge, they can pair up with another trainee on the same level and choose the easy version
- They should use the LOs and syllabus from the previous session to populate the website
- They should focus on setting up one of the options, but if they have time they can try more of them
- Time estimated to be around 20-30 minutes
- For the Quarto option we don't give any specific support, so it should only be used for people that are well versed in Quarto
