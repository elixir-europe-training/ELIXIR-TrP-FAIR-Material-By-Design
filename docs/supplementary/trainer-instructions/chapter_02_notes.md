# Activity 1 

Creating Learning outcomes (LOs)
- Start with a reflexion indivudually what could be the LOs for their training that is being developed in the course
- Define and write the LO's in google docs or any other preferable tool, suggest that they are descriptive using the Bloom's taxonomy framework
- Identify the target audiance and prerequisite (if applicable) and if there is enought time register in the same document.

# Activity 2

Group discussion on Training life cycle
- Make small groups of 2 or 3 people
- Ask them to discuss how each principle of FAIR applies to each of the 5 steps in the training life cycle (slide ...)

# Activity 3: Why is documentation important to the FAIR process?
Think, Pair, Share
This is a question posed to the group. The participants will think about this question for 1 minute, then pair up with someone nearby them, and discuss their thoughts together, for approximately 2-3 minutes, and then if there is time, they will share a point they have come up with that they feel is especially relevant.
This discussion is meant to encourage participants to think about preservation of trainings and the longevity of a training, how documentation is important to show the evolution of a training, how it is important for showing where authorship and contributions have been made, as well as other things like the temporal contexts of the training (eg. When it was made, how it was made, whether the information within the training is still accurate or up to date)

# Activity 4: How can we best document our trainings to make them FAIR?
Group Discussion
This activity is meant to get the participants thinking about what documentation means in their particular contexts. Is there data to keep? Is there a plan for how this training will be delivered in the future? What happens if a new trainer is introduced, or if someone else takes over the training. There will be differences in what is most appropriate for every individual training.

# Activity 5: What are the differences between metadata and documentation?
Think, Pair, Share
This is a question posed to the group. The participants will think about this question for 1 minute, then pair up with someone nearby them, and discuss their thoughts together, for approximately 2-3 minutes, and then if there is time, they will share a point they have come up with that they feel is especially relevant.
This question is to check that they understand what these differences are, and to prompt them to see that neither metadata nor documentation alone are enough or useful, but both are needed and they complement each other. They are have strong ties to learning outcomes.
