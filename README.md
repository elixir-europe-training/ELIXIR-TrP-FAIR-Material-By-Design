### About this course

This 2 days course is based on the [FAIR training handbook](https://elixir-europe-training.github.io/ELIXIR-TrP-FAIR-training-handbook/) and [10 simple rules to make material FAIR publication](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854). All sessions are structured in a way that complement each other aiming to introduce participants with a theoretical & **hands-on** approach of how to design FAIR training material.

Activities are intended to **increase the technical skills** and **critical thinking** during the development of a new training course. From A to Z participants are going to be challenged to work in a group to build a FAIR lesson on a topic to be presented at the end of the course. Come inspired!
