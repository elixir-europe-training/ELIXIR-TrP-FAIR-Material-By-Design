However, in this context, FAIR refers to an acronym where each letter represents a key principle:  </p> <p>Expecting training materials to be FAIR is only fair \u2014 don\u2019t you agree?  </p> <p>Before deciding whether that statement holds true, it helps to understand what each part of the acronym stands for. The concept of the FAIR principles emerged from the need to enable the reuse of scholarly data in research. These principles define a concise and measurable set of guidelines designed to promote reusability. They emphasize that data and materials should be accessible not only to humans but also in a machine-readable format.  </p> <p>Challenge</p> <p>Before looking at the answers below, try to answer with your current knowledge and perspective.</p> <p>\u201cHow would you interpret each of these principles?\u201d </p> <p>Elaborate shortly how you see each one (in general and for training) and then compare with the text below:</p> <ol> <li>Findable:</li> <li>Accessible:</li> <li>Interoperable:</li> <li>Reusable:</li> </ol> <p>The main goal of the FAIR principles is to SHARE. In the context of training materials, this involves extending, updating and modifying the material to suit specific audiences or circumstances. To support this overarching goal, the four FAIR principles can be translated into ten practical rules for FAIR training, as described by Garcia et al. 2020.   Findable:</p> <p>For data, including training material, to be considered FINDABLE three key aspects should be taken into account: the material needs to be described in such a way that humans and machines can find the material and its metadata, it needs to have a unique identifier and it must be registered online in a catalogue or repository.</p> <p>Accessible:</p> <p>To be considered ACCESSIBLE, the most important aspect is to clearly define the access rules. This can be done through attaching a license, a document stating access rules or an access policy to the material. This information allows anyone who finds the material to understand how it can be accessed and what actions are permitted, such as sharing, reusing, or modifying it. In some cases, the material itself may be restricted or closed, but its metadata should remain discoverable, with the accessibility conditions clearly stated.</p> <p>Interoperable:</p> <p>The main idea behind materials being INTEROPERABLE is that they should work as expected across different operating systems (OS) and platforms. Achieving this can be more complex for training materials than for scientific data, as interoperability has been a focus in data analysis for a longer time. As will be discussed in the section on training materials, there are many types of training resources. Some may open easily on any OS, but may not be simple to edit, extend, or update. The question then becomes: \u201cWhat is the perfect solution?\u201d In practice, several technical options are available, some more suitable than others. However, the degree of interoperability will always depend on specific needs and contextual considerations, which will be explored later in this lesson.</p> <p>Reusable:</p> <p>After considering all the previous principles, the next step is to REUSE existing materials or ensure that new materials are reusable. In the context of training, there are two main groups who can benefit from reuse: (1) trainers and (2) trainees. Trainers should aim to annotate, describe, and present materials as clearly as possible so that others\u2014whether trainers or trainees\u2014can understand the content without requiring the author\u2019s presence. It is also essential to keep your materials up to date, which can be facilitated by welcoming contributions, using collaborative platforms such as GitHub, and providing clear guidelines on how others can contribute.</p> <p>When sharing or reusing materials, it is essential to provide proper attribution to those involved, whether as authors or contributors. Recognition ensures that the time and effort invested by individuals is acknowledged, unless a CC0 or similar license has been applied. This topic will be explored further in the following chapters. </p> <p> Ten simple rules for making training materials FAIR.

Clear rules determine whether material can be freely accessed, modified, and shared, or whether certain restrictions apply to specific groups. Access may be limited, for example, through platform registration, and authors can specify how and with whom materials may be shared. Last but not least, a resource can have restricted or closed access and still be considered FAIR: the metadata and information about the material remain discoverable, even if the content itself cannot be accessed. </p> <p>From the course: RDM: your aly in your way to your publication</p>"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_01/#14-why-create-fair-training-material","title":"1.4 Why create FAIR training material?","text":"<p>Making training materials FAIR enables community exchange and allows the content to have a lasting impact.

It defines how online learning content and LMSs communicate with each other, for example for tracking whether a learner has completed a module or how much time they spent on it. SCORM packages training materials into a standardized format (usually a .zip file) that can be imported into almost any LMS.   xAPI (Experience API), also known as Tin Can API, is a newer and more flexible standard. Unlike SCORM, it can track learning experiences both inside and outside an LMS, for example attending a workshop, watching a video, or participating in a simulation. It then stores this data in a Learning Record Store (LRS). CMI5 builds on xAPI, combining the structure of SCORM with the versatility of xAPI.

No matter what type of resource, it can be any kind of training material, support material, images, videos, etc. There are different types of liscenses to support you in keeping the property rights clear. Most of the time when talking about training material we are talking about a creative work. In this case a good license option is the creative commons (CC). </p> <p>The CC licenses will allow you to combine different options, depending if you want to make it fully open, or if you want to make clear some limitations of the use of your material. An example is to have it open but restricted to the obligation of acknowledging the original work, so people can use and adapt as long as a citation is made. In other hands, maybe you prefer that it is not used for commercial purposes, or that it can only be using as long as keeping the same license type.</p> <p>It is an scale, see it bellow:</p> <p>Creative commons license spectrum by Shaddim; original CC license symbols by Creative Commons. CCBYSA 4.0</p> <p>If you see a CC0 means you can freely use! While (C) means all rights reserved. Between them you can find many options, for example the CCBY, second one in the right top, means you can share and adapt as long as citing by whom it was created.</p> <p>As you have seen in the previous chapter, open and FAIR are not the same. So even if you have all rights reserved it can still be FAIR, it can be findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Maybe to reuse you need to pay, but it means it is not open, however it is still FAIR. What we strongly encourage is to use a CCBY or similar, where you are recognized but it is still open, so, combining both principles FAIR and OPEN.</p> <p>It is good to remember that this should be taken into account in both directions! Always\u2026 I mean ALWAYS check the licenses of materials, images and videos you want to use, and add a license to your materials too.</p> <p>If you are accessing a CCBY license you should take in account some good practices of how to make good citations/atribution </p> <p>Challenge</p> <p>I challenge you to take a look in the links and the options and choose one license for your project. Discuss with your group the advantages and disadvantages and let\u2019s go one step ahead in being FAIR.</p> <p>You can use the help of the license chooser from creative commons</p> <p>At this point there one thing about liceses that I believe you have not started asking yet. WHERE SHOULD I PUT THE LICENSE?</p> <p>The easier answer to that is \u201cTHE MOST EVIDENT PLACE YOU CAN FIND\u201d, if we are talking about slides try to keep this information with an image in your cover, include a link for people to be redirected to the full description in case they want to check all the conditions. If you are usinf a GitHub page, use the License function, this will create an easy to access tab with all the information about the choosen license, but I would advise to also include in yout README.md file. If it is in a text or video, make it evident and always include a link close to it or in the description so people can be sure of how accessible and reusable this resource is.</p> <p>It is also importante that you think and evaluate carrefully what license you want to apply since these also come with some terms for the licensor. Please check what to consider before choosing a license from creative commons and starting to distribute the material.</p> <p>Last but not least, when citing another license there are good and bad ways to do it, you can check all the recommended practices by Creative Commons. </p> <p>A good citation will include all the information needed to find back the original source, you can include the Title, Author, Source, and License or include the link to the source, the author and the link to the license.</p> <p>For this course material you could do, for example: Training material made FAIR by design, from  Alexander Botxki, Bruna Piereck, Elin Kronander, Jessica Lindvall, Jill Jaworski, Kristen Schroeder and Nina Norgren. CCBYSA 4.0</p> <p>If you have modified the original you also need to make it clear to everyone. Here is one example from CC recommended practices guide of how to do it:</p> <p>This work, \u201c90fied\u201d, is adapted from \u201cCreative Commons 10th Birthday Celebration San Francisco\u201d by Timothy Vollmer, used under CC BY 4.0. \u201c90fied\u201d is licensed under CC BY 4.0 by [Your name here].</p> <p>In this example you know the image was changed to have a 90\u2019s look, not present in the original picture.</p> <p>Enought of this, let\u2019s start looking into some resources we usually access and check their licenses.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_05/#54-authorship-and-recognition","title":"5.4 Authorship and recognition","text":"<p>When thinking of scientific publications, it is more or less intuitive that authors and co-authors need to be listed and that when making use of any of the information that sholud be cited. For training material, despite not being an automatic action the same should apply. As you saw before depending on the license they should be cited and what you can and cannot do is defined.</p> <p>This is very important for the recognition and responsibility of those who have been dedicated to create, review, update training materials and have shared them with either trainees and trainers.</p> <p>For training material, however we have Authors, contributors and trainers/teachers. Sometimes the same person plays more than one role, but they are different roles and should be acknowledged as such. But to give proper recognition we need to define each role. See below how they were defined in the FAIR training handbook:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Author: Have made substantial contribution, can approve or not the version and are personally accountable for their contribution</p> </li> <li> <p>Contributor: Tests, evaluates and improves the content (exercises, lectures, etc)</p> </li> <li> <p>Trainer: Have interactions with the trainee (learner) as part of didactic process while making use of the material</p> </li> </ul> <p>Use this descriptions to help you define who has the author\u2019s role and who is the contributor. One thing important here to highlight is that substantial contribution is not exactly defined. Each group might have a slightly different view on it and it can help, like in the papers, to describe what each person has done. However, I would focus in the fact that an author should be accountable for the material and its approval.</p> <p>In the FAIR training handbook you can also find a Credit matrix to help defining  the  responsibilities of authors in the creation of the training material. </p> <p>Complementary, in some cases there is another layer where founders and institutions/organizations must have their share of contribution acknowledged also. Generally speaking, it is advised that whenever creating or re-using material the same guidelines for academic citations and acknowledgements should apply, and you can also include a guideline or copy-paste text for people to easily cite the material.</p> <p>Is good to keep in mind that training material includes but is not limited by presentations. it also refers to text, quizzes, list of literature, videos, etc. You will see more about it in the session about training materials.</p> <p>And where should you include such a piece of information, it might vary depending on the material?</p> <ul> <li> <p>Dedicated slide</p> </li> <li> <p>In the metadata</p> </li> <li> <p>In the cover page of material</p> </li> <li> <p>In the website page or README.md document</p> </li> <li> <p>Logos and names in the video and video description</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_05/#55-illustrations","title":"5.5 Illustrations","text":""},{"location":"chapters/chapter_05/#images-with-free-licenses","title":"Images with free licenses","text":"<p>Many of us, if not all, are used to finding images on your favorite search engine and copy-pasting it to make a shine, bright and attractive presentation, text or to illustrate whatever training material we will develop. </p> <p>Despite of being tempting, you should not do it as simple as this.

Well, there are a few things to consider. Check the next topic.</p> <ol> <li>with genAI</li> </ol> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI), specifically in times like this with an astronomical growth of generative AI (genAI), it is a tempting and very powerful tool. However AI exists for a long time, in the way we know it now the world is just learning from it and adjusting constantly to such power and its consequences. I\u2019ll not spend time talking about how this tool works, but I find important to highlight For the generative AI, thinking from the illustrations point of view there are still a lot of uncertainty.</p> <p>There is no one agreement to whom own the image rights, not all genAI make openly clear what database is being used to train their algorithm. What brings the most important consideration, genAI is trained based in existante image-references and this has several consequences, I\u2019ll try to mention some that you should be careful with just before telling how you can use this resource to your benefit.</p> <p>First you need to consider that the world we live is been fighting againt a lot of biases and genAI is not very good at fighting it, unless you make your description very clear (and that is our biggest challegne perhaps). In world with etinical and gender bieases among many others, genAI has the tendency of returning images that reinforce these patterns so you need to be mindful and probably do some reiterations to get away from these.</p> <p>In this example I only asked Copilot - Microsfot to draw a politician, nothing more then that. You can see bellow what is generate without further instruction.</p> <p>When asked with a very general request \u201cdraw a politician\u201d the tool will most likely reproduce societal biases. As you cann see a politician despite of being a agender therm returns in tis majority light skin tone man, in strong quit angry posture. There are a lot of flags around.</p> <p>Photo from \u201cStrategic use of genAI\u201d VIBcourse, by Bruna Piereck and Alexander Botzki. CCBY 4.0 License.</p> <p>When reiteraiting and asking the tool - \u201cmake them women\u201d - still very general but trying to steer the tool in another direction that is what we get back:</p> <p>Mostly light skin ton people, women however look calm and reserved, their posture is almost the oposit of the one above.</p> <p>Photo from \u201cStrategic use of genAI\u201d VIBcourse, by Bruna Piereck and Alexander Botzki. CCBY 4.0 License.</p> <p>There are also general aspects that you can look, all of them are quit conservative,women tend to look yonger then man. I wont go further on that, but when trying it on your own be mindifil and give context to steer in the desired direction.</p> <p>Another very important thing to take into account is the copyrights around GenAI-images. It is not clear yet how to define it, and each country might have a different way to approach it. Regardless, it is all so new, that I would expect that there is still a lot to happen around this discussion.</p> <p>But to give you an overview on the topic, and most importantly, some hints on how to navigate this waters. In 2023 Lim Yong Lin, a lawyer working with intellectual property, and Anas Hassan, text writer and computer scientist exploring AI, both commented in some of the challenges to determine who has the copyrights of an AI generated image. </p> <p>From the technological point if we advocate that AI is the one generating the image, it might be argued that it belongs to the person or company operating the AI system.It could also be argued that who provided the data to train the AI or has trained the AI, owns it since they are \u201cthe source\u201d. But the creative input is given by a third person that is accessing the AI and giving their instructions something was created, so they should have the copyrights for the \u201cidea\u201d. To close this complex reflexion, I would like to bring the perspective that if AI is using existing data, and if the image contains references to another piece how do you define where the copyrights of the original piece ends and the AI generated image beggins? </p> <p>The point is, there is no clear definition yet to solve any of the discussions above, and so it is most likely seen case-by-case.</p> <p>But we agree it is a nice and useful tool to create images, so to try to avoid problems there are things you can consider. While it might seem obvious, is still very good to remember. Here is the list of hints based in what Annas Hassan said in his article:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Use AI to create works that are sufficiently different from existing works</p> <ul> <li>Use different datasets</li> <li>Use unique prompts and parameters</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Use AI to assist in the creative process rather than replacing it! </p> <ul> <li>Uee AI to generate ideas and inspiration</li> <li>Combine with a human creator</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Make clear you have used AI and which genAI you have used</p> <ul> <li>P.S.: This can help avoiding confusion and misunderstandings about the originality</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Be mindful with the description you give to genAI</p> <ul> <li>Think twice before utilizing any artist\u2019s name</li> <li>Think twice before using other creations as reference</li> <li>Avoid mentioning works that are already protected by copyright</li> <li>Uploading existing reference is prohibited unless you own the copyright</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Check you AI tool\u2019s policies and terms of service</p> <ul> <li>Not all of them allow for commercial usage of the generated photos/images</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Avoid very general suggestions</p> <ul> <li>it tends to use reinforced biases of age, gender, race, etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Use tools for reverse image search to verify outcomes.</p> <ul> <li>examples: Google Lens or Google Reverse Image</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Save the prompt that was used to generate each image</p> <ul> <li>Save it in the metadata for future reference</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>\u201cMost AI Image Generators still stand on their terms that all generated images are free to use, but it is still better to reference the image to the platform of the creator when using them, \u201d -Anas Hassan-</p> <p>AI images copyrights by Anas Hassan, feb 2023.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_05/#to-keep-in-mind-when-choosing-illustrations","title":"To keep in mind when choosing illustrations","text":"<ul> <li>Keep it clean and meaninful</li> <li>Avoid stereotypes, be inlcusive</li> <li>Check the licenses</li> <li>Make citations and include links to original source</li> </ul>"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_06/","title":"6.

This improves findability, as search engines and repositories can index the text and help others discover your content. It also enhances accessibility, ensuring that people with hearing impairments or those who prefer reading can still engage with the material. In addition, transcripts and captions promote interoperability by allowing the content to be reused across different platforms, formats, or languages. Finally, they increase reusability, since the text can be cited, translated, remixed, or integrated into other learning materials, all while preserving the original meaning and context.

If I\u2019m very practical I could tell that Metadata is just data used to describe other Data. Metadata should, however, live independently. The metadata has the function of describing and defining parameters that will make easier to find and compare other similar data.</p> <p>Let me try to put in an example to make it easier:</p> <p>You look at a can (data) of a new beverage and later comment this with a friend who wants to know more. You do not remember the name (metadata) of the beverage, but you tell your friend about the height and colours of the can (metadata). Your friend quickly realises what that new beverage is as she has already tried it out.</p> <p>Example from FAIR handbook (chapter 04), by ELIXIR training platform. CCBYSA 4.0 license</p> <p>As said before and you can see in the example, the metadata helps describing the data, this will be important in the data retrival, meaning - people can more easily find it - and also in the comparison with similar data, in our case other training materials.</p> <p>But looking into another example from the chapter 04 from the FAIR handbook:</p> <p>You look for a film (data) in your preferred browser. As you know the title (metadata) you can easily find not only the film (access is restricted to those renting the film) but information about the director and the actors, and even a summary of the plot (more metadata).</p> <p>In this example includes not only humans, but also machines. You can lookup in the brounser and find a lot of information about the movie, nonetheless is most probably that you can only watch it if you pay a fee or have a streaming account. The metada of the movie that is retrieved might look like has a lot of free text, what is great for humans, but machines need more structure for better functioning</p> <p>The sort of structured metadata we use to describe training materials will look a like having a key concept followed by a description. Ideally this descriptions as much as the key concept will use therms with clear meanings. For example:</p> <p>Title: Course Title Author: Name FamilyName Level: Begginers</p> <p>As part of being clear and machine redable, the more we focus in Ontology, the more we can achieve. Do you know what is an ontology?</p> <p>Ontology according to the definition from Oxford Languages is a set of concepts and categories in a subject area or domain that shows their properties and the relations between them. For example, we can look into the controled vocabulary for pants, this is one concept that has propeties and relations:</p> Pants Categories Adults Casual Sports Dress Children Dress Play <p>You have Pants as a term, and it can be categorized for Adults and Children and within them Casual, Sports, Dress and Play. This way the information is structures and can easily be identified by machines and comapring and finding similar things will be easier, like when you filter for searching in a online clothes shoping. </p> <p>But for training, as expected, we have other categories, and they are defined with Schemas.org and Bioschmas.org</p>"},{"location":"chapters/chapter_07/#73-schemas-and-bioschemas","title":"7.3 Schemas and Bioschemas","text":"<p>Bioschemas is a collaborative effort supporting metadata schemas to describe types relevant in the Life Sciences domain (e.g., Gene and Protein) and providing guidelines (known as profiles) on how to use general-purpose types offered by Schema.org (e.g., Dataset or Learning Resource).

A course usually covers an individual subject. Such a course will be linked to several course instances that happen at different moments, locations and might be also subjected to updates and small differences in the material. A course and/or course instance should be linked to a course material, that represents the content of this course/course instance. In TeSS, though, courses and courses instances are in called Event in the interface, while this is not the same as the profile in schemas.org. It works to filter among all courses, webinars, symposia, congresses etc.</p> <p>Note that the CourseInstance profile is used in tandem with the Course profile, i.e., a CourseInstance does not exist without a Course but a Course can exist without a CourseInstance (there are no current offerings of the course).</p> <p>Such an event in TeSS is a link to a single training event sourced by a provider along with description and related meta information (e.g. date, location, audience, ontological categorization, keywords, etc.). </p> <p>Training events in TeSS can be added manually or automatically harvested from a provider\u2019s website.

PIDs are often used in the context of digital objects and are actionable, meaning that you can resolve them in a web browser and be taken to a webpage containing the digital object and its associated metadata. Actual access to the digital object on this page might be restricted, as a PID may be connected to a set of metadata describing an item rather than to the item itself. The primary purpose of a PID is to provide the information required to reliably identify, verify, and locate the resource it is associated with. To achieve this, PIDs must comply with a few key principles:  </p> <ul> <li> <p>Globally unique:</p> <p>To ensure global uniqueness, a PID should follow a controlled syntax to avoid conflicts. This can be achieved for example by using namespaces that are governed by clearly defined authorities. </p> </li> <li> <p>Persistent: </p> <p>The identifier, and the object it points to, should be maintained over the long term. The syntax used for the identifier should also remain persistent. </p> </li> <li> <p>Resolvable: </p> <p>The identifier should allow both human and machine users to access the resource or its related information.</p> </li> </ul> <p>One of the most common PIDs used by public repositories is the  Digital Object Identifier (DOI) (doi.org). DOIs are coupled with metadata that can be modified over time and to keep track of the locations and characteristics of the objects they identify. DOIs are generated automatically when you make your resources available in a repository such as Dataverse or Zenodo, or when a research article is published.   </p> <p>DOI relies on a non-profit organisation that is the governance body of the federation of registration agencies.

They also provide a structured place to store and manage metadata, which can be read by both humans and machines. Because DOIs are machine-actionable, they improve searchability and discoverability, helping others easily find your materials through search engines or automated systems.</p> <p>Accessible (A): Each DOI resolves to a landing page that contains information about the resource and how to access it. Even if the location of the actual file changes, the DOI will always direct users to the current metadata or resource, ensuring that access remains consistent over time.</p> <p>Interoperable (I): While a DOI itself does not automatically make a resource interoperable, the standardized metadata schemas (such as those provided by DataCite) help ensure that data and information can be shared and understood across different systems and repositories.</p> <p>Reusable (R): DOIs enhance citability and attribution, allowing others to reference your work accurately.

For training materials, the following PIDs are the most important:</p> <ul> <li> <p>ORCID ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) provides a unique and persistent identifier for individual researchers, free of charge. It helps distinguish between people with similar names (homonyms) and ensures that your work is correctly attributed to you, regardless of name changes or institutional moves. ORCID allows you to add aliases if your name changes, and your ORCID iD remains the same even when you change affiliations. This makes it a powerful tool for maintaining your research identity over time, ensuring that you always get proper credit and that your scholarly contributions are easy to track globally.</p> </li> <li> <p>ROR  The Research Organization Registry (ROR) is a global, community-led registry that assigns open persistent identifiers to research organizations. ROR helps systems and users unambiguously identify institutions and connect them to researchers and research outputs. For example, Science for Life Laboratory is often referred to as SciLifeLab. To avoid confusion between names, the SciLifeLab ROR ID uniquely identifies the organization, ensuring consistent and accurate affiliation metadata across platforms and publications.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Together, ORCID, ROR, and DOI form the foundation for making your training materials, their creators and institutions clearly identifiable, citable, and FAIR.  </p> <p>Reflection</p> <p>In the context of training materials why are PIDs needed?

BioCommons chose to use Zenodo to share training materials because they do not have a repository of their own, and Zenodo has established ways of managing metadata, DOIs and versioning. It is also widely used in the scientific community.</p> <p>For each event, a Zenodo record is created that includes detailed metadata, new training materials and links to previous materials that were reused as part of the training (Figure 1).</p> <p>Two types of PIDs are used when sharing materials from events:</p> <ul> <li> <p>DOIs - Zenodo automatically assigns a DOI to the event. DOIs are also used when linking to related materials to ensure that there is no ambiguity about which materials were used.</p> </li> <li> <p>ORCID - Trainers\u2019 ORCIDs are used to ensure that they get the credit for their efforts and to make it clear who participated in the event.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Figure 1: The Australian BioCommons collates materials from their events and shares them via Zenodo where they are assigned a DOI and authors are identified via their ORCIDs. View this record on Zenodo.</p> Case 2 - Creating virtual collections of training materials and assigning own PIDs <p>For CLARIN, a training event typically includes slides, handouts, a GitHub page, video tutorials, language resources, datasets, and/or tools. The slides and handouts are published on the event web page, while video recordings of the presentations are made available on the CLARIN YouTube channel. In addition, the language resources and tools used during the training are stored in CLARIN\u2019s national repositories, where they are assigned unique identifiers by the hosting institutions, ensuring that they can be cited and reliably referenced.</p> <p>One solution to have a PID assigned to all the materials used during one training event is to create a virtual collection in the CLARIN Virtual Collection Registry. A virtual collection is a coherent set of links of digital objects that can be easily created, accessed and cited with the help of PIDs, e.g. a DOI. The links can originate from different archives. Here is an example of a virtual collection created for a hands-on tutorial on transcribing interview data.</p> <p> Figure 2: Example of a training collection in the CLARIN Virtual Collection Registry that has been assigned a persistent identifier.</p> <p> </p> <p>Figure 3: Example of a BibTeX citation in the CLARIN Virtual Collection Registry.</p> <p>Other practices that the trainers in the CLARIN community have adopted are:</p> <ul> <li>Depositing the training materials together with the datasets in their CLARIN national data repository. See example: Archilochus of Paros: Elegiac Fragments - XML Archive. The advantage of using this path is that the authors can add more extensive metadata to describe their materials. </li> <li>Depositing the training materials on Zenodo. See example: Introduction to Speech Analysis. In this case, related identifiers are included that lead users to the main platform where the course is stored and maintained. </li> <li>Adding the metadata of the training materials to the SSHOC Open Marketplace, see example: Jupyter notebooks for Europeana newspaper text resource processing with CLARIN NLP tools. In this case, the Marketplace does not assign any unique identifiers, but the authors can identify themselves via their ORCID and can suggest a citation format for their collection.</li> </ul> Case 3 - Separate DOIs for mixing and matching in a community <p>The Dutch Techcentre for Life Sciences (DTL) has a Zenodo community to upload presentations and course materials. DTL has chosen to give separate DOIs for individual, often topical, elements of a course. An example is the Helis Academy FAIR Datastewardship Course, a course of 6 half days. </p> <p>Providing a separate DOI has the following advantages: </p> <ul> <li>It is easier to mix and match different modules as part of a learning path, i.e. different combinations of training modules can be made for the various target audiences, tailored to that specific purpose.  </li> <li>When updating or revising a single module, it is more convenient to have that module as a separate entity with its own DOI, in order to easily keep track of the versions of different modules.  </li> </ul> <p>At the level of the full course, DTL uses ELIXIR TeSS as the registry.

The public repositories Zenodo and Figshare integrate directly with GitHub to automatically issue DOIs for repositories. These integrations rely on GitHub <code>releases</code>, which are essentially snapshots of your project taken at a specific point in time. A release packages your project in a stable, downloadable form, making it easier for others to access and use. Each release is linked to a version number (for example, v1.0) and is created from a specific <code>tag</code> in your GitHub repository. Tags mark particular commits in the project\u2019s history, allowing you and others to track the evolution of your work and see what has changed between versions.</p> <p>In addition to tagging a release, you can add a <code>title</code> and <code>release notes</code> to include basic metadata that describes what has changed in that version. If you use Zenodo to archive your GitHub repository, the release notes are automatically imported as the record\u2019s <code>description</code>, while some metadata fields are populated by default, e.g. <code>Resource type</code> is set to \u201cSoftware\u201d and a link to the GitHub repository is included under <code>related works</code> (or can be added manually if needed). </p> <p>Each time you create a new release, a new version of your Zenodo or Figshare record is generated, and a new DOI is issued. This DOI and the DOIs representing previous versions are automatically linked together, and an additional DOI is created to represent all versions of the record collectively.

Our conversation has highlighted the various formats we use to disseminate knowledge in life sciences, each with its own set of advantages and challenges. PowerPoint (PPT and PPTX) - Advantages: These formats are easily (re)usable, widely available across different operating systems and software, and have widespread recognition. - Disadvantages: They provide a limited scope for delivering detailed training instructions and lack version control. Keynote - Advantages: Offers a polished overall aesthetic that can enhance the presentation quality. - Disadvantages: Its usage is confined to the macOS family, and it does not support version control. PDF - Advantages: PDFs ensure consistent display across various environments, maintaining the integrity of the content. - Disadvantages: They are not easily editable, which can be a hindrance when updates are needed, and they also lack version control. TeX - Advantages: TeX is easily editable and supports version control, making it a robust choice for collaborative work. - Disadvantages: However, it comes with a steep learning curve that can be a barrier for some trainers. Markdown (MD), reStructuredText (RST), and HTML - Advantages: These formats are version controlled and free, promoting accessibility and ease of updates. - Disadvantages: They require rendering, which may necessitate additional steps to convert into a visually appealing HTML format. Google Slides - Advantages: Google Slides are version controlled and freely available, supporting collaborative efforts. - Disadvantages: Their usage can be restricted by local or institutional policies, and accessibility issues may arise depending on the user\u2019s geographic location. As we continue with our training, let\u2019s consider how these formats serve our objectives and the ways in which we can leverage their strengths while mitigating their limitations.

Still, in this section, we will provide a definition of interoperability for training materials, and we will explain how this concept is related to the idea of reusability. Regarding reusability, it is essential to make a distinction between: Reusing parts of material by repurposing it for a new context or integrating it into another set of materials, Reusing the material exactly as it is. File formats will have different implications in the context of FAIRness depending on the two types of material reuse. Some formats facilitate FAIRness while others don\u2019t.

HTML pages provide greater re-usability and extendability, allowing for dynamic content and easier updates. PowerPoint files are somewhat reusable but can be cumbersome to update and share collaboratively. Google Presentations enhance re-usability through cloud-based collaboration and real-time updates, though they still face limitations in format compatibility. Markdown-based material stands out for its high degree of re-usability and extendability, being easily editable, version-controlled, and convertible to various formats. Looking ahead, the future of interoperable training material formats lies in developing standards that ensure seamless integration across platforms.
